      <p>
        Shirshasana, or Headstand, is an advanced inverted yoga posture often referred to as the "King of Asanas" due to the wealth of benefits it offers. In this pose, the head lightly touches the ground while the arms and shoulders bear most of the body's weight, promoting strength, balance, and resilience.
