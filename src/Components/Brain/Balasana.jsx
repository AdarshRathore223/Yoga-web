        Balasana - Child's Pose
      </h1>
      <p>
        Balasana, or Child's Pose, is a simple yoga posture symbolizing rest, release, and self-reflection. Practitioners kneel on the mat, sit back onto their heels, extend their arms forward, and gently place the forehead on the ground. The body folds inward, creating a sense of security and comfort.
