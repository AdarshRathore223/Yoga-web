        Padmasana - Lotus Pose
      </h1>
      <p>
        Padmasana, or Lotus Pose, is an ancient seated meditation posture where both feet rest atop the opposite thighs. The spine remains upright and aligned, the hands rest gently on the knees, and the gaze softens into a comfortable position, creating an ideal foundation for deep meditation and inner stillness.
