        Fish Pose (Matsyasana) â€“ Opening the Heart and Lungs
      </h1>
      <p>
        Fish Pose, or Matsyasana, is a heart-centered pose that opens the heart
        and deeply stretches the chest and allows one to expand their lung
        capacity. Fish Pose is beneficial for individuals who spend a lot of
        time rounding forward collapsing their chest while at their desk, on
        their phone, or driving in a seated position. Fish Pose tends to open
        the heart space while teaching the individual to breathe a full breath
        by filling up their chest and lungs to capacity.
      </p>

      <p>To practice Fish Pose:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Laying on your back with the legs extended.</li>
        <li>Slide your hands under your hips, palms down.</li>
        <li>
          Press into your elbows lifting your chest and lightly arching and
          tipping your head back so the crown of your head is resting lightly on
          the floor.
        </li>
        <li>Keep your chest up, widen the collarbones.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This gentle backbend creates space in your rib cage to open the chest
        and allows the lungs to expand and breathe. It brings fresh blood
        circulation to the respiratory system and in some cases can relieve mild
        respiratory ailments. With consistent intention and practice, Fish Pose
        may also assist in keeping asthma or bronchitis episodes at bay.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are a beginner, you can make this pose accessible and just as
        effective by placing a block or bolster (if you have one) under your
        upper back. Fish Pose is best held for 30 seconds to 1 minute, allowing
        for the opportunity to take full advantage of the stretch by breathing
        deeply and rhythmically as you feel your chest and lungs expand. Regular
        practice of Fish Pose nurtures not only lung health but also emotional
        resilience, promoting a sense of openness and vitality that can be
        carried throughout the day.
