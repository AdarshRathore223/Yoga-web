        Cow Face Pose - Gomukhasana
      </h1>
      <p>
        Cow Face Pose, or Gomukhasana, is a deceptively deep posture that greatly benefits the lungs. While it primarily deals with tight shoulders, chest, and back that can restrict breathing, it is also traditionally a hip-opening pose. This posture stretches the upper body, allowing for more space to breathe deeply and freely.

      <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#254a48] mt-4">Entering Gomukhasana:</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Sit with one leg crossed over the other, stacking the knees neatly on top of each other.</li>
        <li>Lift the right arm overhead, bend the elbow, and slide the right hand down the spine.</li>
        <li>Bring the left arm behind the back and try to clasp the hands. If clasping is difficult, use a strap.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mt-4">
        Remember to lift the chest and draw the shoulders away from the ears to avoid collapsing into the posture. Focus on inhaling and exhaling deeply into the rib cage, while enjoying the stretch across the chest and shoulders.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
        Gomukhasana helps relieve tension in the thoracic spine and shouldersâ€”areas often compressed by daily stress. Tightness here leads to shallow breathing, but practicing this pose frees the body to fully inhale and exhale without restrictions.
      </p>

        Regular practice, even just a few minutes each day, can improve physical posture and expand breath capacity, making Cow Face Pose a valuable addition to any yoga practice focused on respiratory health.
