        Setu Bandhasana (Bridge Pose)
      </h1>
      <p>
        Setu Bandhasana, (Bridge Pose) is a heart-opening, strengthening pose
        that stabilizes the spine, glutes, and legs, and stretches the chest,
        neck, and hip flexors. The name comes from the Sanskrit words setu
        (bridge), bandha (lock), and asana (position).
      </p>

      <h1 className="text-xl font-medium text-[#254a48] hover:underline cursor-pointer">
        Here's how to do Setu Bandhasana:
      </h1>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          Lie on your back with knees bent and feet hip-width and flat on the
          floor.
        </li>
        <li>Let your arms rest down by your side with palms down.</li>
        <li>
          As you inhale, press through your feet and lift your hips toward the
          ceiling.
        </li>
        <li>
          Focus on your thighs remaining parallel and the opening of your chest
          with the sternum moving toward your chin.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can lace your hands underneath your back or keep your palms
          pressing down into the mat.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Bridge Pose offers an opportunity to relieve stress and anxiety, a sense
        of buoyancy in mild depression, increases flexibility in the spine, and
        stimulates the organs in your abdomen for improved digestion, and
        strengthens the lower part of your body. It is also a great pose to
        reflect on, for members of the community who are presently experiencing
        discomfort in the lower back and restricted range of motion associated
        with daily movement.
