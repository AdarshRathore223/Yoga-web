      <p>
        Bhujangasana, also known as Cobra Pose, is a nice, gentle backbend that
        creates strength in the spine and opens the chest. The word Bhujangasana
        is derived from the Sanskrit words bhujanga (cobra) and asana (pose),
        since the lifted chest resembles a cobra raising it's hood.

        To practice Bhujangasana:
      </h1>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          Begin in a facing down position with the legs extended, tops of feet
          on the mat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place your hands under your shoulders, with elbows kept close to your
          body.
        </li>
        <li>
          On an inhale, lift the chest off the ground using primarily your back
          muscles
        </li>
        <li>
          Elbows remain slightly bent, with shoulders kept down and relaxed,
          drawing them down as you connect shoulder blades in the back.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This pose creates a stretch of the chest, lungs, shoulders, and abdomen
        while relieving stiffness in the lower back. Bhujangasana, also improves
        posture, expands the lungs, and stimulates the digestive organs. It is
        energizing, and a great pose to include in a morning yoga flow.
