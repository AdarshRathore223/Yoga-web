      <p>
        Ustrasana, or camel pose, is a common deep backbend that does many
        things in yoga practice; it helps open the front of the body, helps
        expand the chest, and creates flexibility in the spine. The word
        Ustrasana comes from the Sanskrit word ustra, which means camel, and
        asana, which means posture. The figure of the camel is clear in this
        pose due to the deep arch of the back mimicking the camel-shaped curve.

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>
          Kneel on the mat with your knees hip-distance apart and thighs
          perpendicular to the mat.
        </li>
        <li>
          
          Place your hands on your lower back for support, or extend your reach
          and grab your heels.
        </li>
        <li>
          
          Lift your chest up and lightly push your hips forward until your spine
          extends.
        </li>
        <li>Let your head fall back naturally, keeping your neck relaxed. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The camel pose creates a stretch in the entire front of the body, that
        is chest, abdomen, thighs, and hip flexors, and helps to strengthen the
        muscles in the back. It can help improve posture, reduces fatigue, and
        stimulates the nervous system. The camel pose also opens the heart
        chakra by encouraging an emotional release and inviting balance from
        within.
