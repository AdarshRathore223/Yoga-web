        Cat-Cow Stretch - Marjaryasana-Bitilasana
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Cat-Cow Stretch is a gentle flow between two poses that warms up the spine, increases flexibility, and prepares the body for movement. In the Cow Pose, the belly drops and the gaze lifts, creating an arch in the back. In the Cat Pose, the spine rounds towards the ceiling, the belly pulls in, and the chin tucks to the chest.
