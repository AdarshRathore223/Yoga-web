        Ardha Matsyendrasana, or Half Lord of the Fishes Pose, is a popular seated spinal twist that dramatically affects digestion and internal cleansing. In this posture, you sit with one leg crossed over the opposite thigh, twist your torso toward the bent knee, hook one elbow over the knee, and use the opposite hand for support behind your back.
